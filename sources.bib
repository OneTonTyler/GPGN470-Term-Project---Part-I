abstract = {The foundations behind the utilization of reflected GNSS signals for environmental research were laid down in the 1990s. Several pioneering works laid the groundwork for using these “signals of opportunity.” Martin-Neira proposed the Passive Reflectometry and Interferometry System (PARIS) for using signals of opportunity for ocean altimetry (Martin-Neira, 1993). The developed methodologies can be classified into categories, based on platforms and signals used. The platform classification includes spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based techniques. Classification based on the signal property includes Doppler-delay map (DDM), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and carrier-phase observation techniques. In terms of receiving station's setups, there are upward-looking and side-looking single-antenna setups, as well as dual-antenna setups, i.e., one upward-looking and one side- or downward-looking antenna. Each technique is briefly described in this chapter. These techniques enable the measurement of (1) wind speed over water bodies (see “GNSS-R wind speed measurements” section), (2) water level height including sea level (see “GNSS-R water level/land height measurements” section) and land elevation, (3) soil moisture (“GNSS-R soil moisture monitoring” section), (4) vegetation, and (5) snow height observations (see Fig. 8.1).},

@article{Elevation_Angle_Impact,
abstract = {The Earth's surface bistatic reflectivity Gamma(LHCP,CyGNSS) is experimentally characterized using the novel Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) L -band passive multistatic radar technique from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite Systems (CyGNSS) eight-microsatellite constellation. The focus of this study is to evaluate the influence of the GNSS satellites' elevation angle theta(e) on Gamma(LHCP,cyGNss), as a function of soil moisture content (SMC) and effective surface roughness parameter h. As the average response, the change of the scattering regime at a global scale and considering also vegetated surfaces appears at theta(e) approximate to 55 degrees. This empirical observation is understood as a change on the dominant scattering term, from incoherent to coherent. Then, the correlation of Gamma(LHCP,CyGNSS) and SMC is evaluated as a function of theta(e) over specific sparsely vegetated target areas. The smoother the surface, the higher the angular variability of the Pearson correlation coefficients. Over croplands (e.g., Argentinian Pampas), an improved correlation coefficient is achieved over angular ranges where the coherent scattering regime becomes the dominant one. As such, this function depends on the surface roughness. The maximum correlation coefficients are found at different theta(e) for increasing mean roughness levels: r(pampas) approximate to 0.78 at theta(e) approximate to [60,70]degrees r(India) approximate to 0.72 at theta(e) approximate to [50,60]degrees, and r(Sudan) approximate to 0.74 at theta(e) [30,40]degrees. SMC retrieval algorithms based on GNSS-R multi -angular information could benefit from these findings, so as to improve the accuracy using single-polarized signals.},

@article{Semiempirical_Modeling,
abstract = {Data from the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission augmented with a physical surface scattering model were analyzed to develop a semiempirical model, which consists of three main modeling components for soil moisture, vegetation, and surface roughness. CYGNSS data collected from March 2017 to March 2020 were collocated with the soil moisture data from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and climatology vegetation water content (VWC) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The matchup data were binned as a function of soil moisture, VWC, and incidence angle. The CYGNSS data were calibrated using a coherent reflection equation to obtain an effective reflectivity. The response of CYGNSS effective reflectivity to soil moisture changes is consistent with the change of the Fresnel reflectivity based on Mironov's soil dielectric constant model used by the SMAP and Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions for soil moisture retrieval. The CYGNSS effective reflectivity decreases approximately linearly (in dB) with respect to the NDVI-VWC. The estimated values of vegetation attenuation parameter (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">b </tex-math></inline-formula>) agree with values published in the literature and are corroborated with the estimated values of <inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">b </tex-math></inline-formula> using the SMAP dual-polarized channel algorithm based on land cover types. A CYGNSS surface scattering map has been derived and reveals a mixed contribution of coherent and incoherent scattering effects and the effects of topography. The semiempirical model, leveraging two of the key modeling functions used by microwave radiometry, will pave the way for a synergistic use of reflectometry and radiometry data for multiparameter retrieval and development of consistent soil moisture products.},

@article{GNSS_R_Spaceborn_Challenges,
abstract = {Soil moisture is the most active part of the terrestrial water cycle, and it is a key variable that affects hydrological, bio-ecological, and bio-geochemical processes. Microwave remote sensing is an effective means of monitoring soil moisture, but the existing conventional radiometers and single-station radars cannot meet the scientific needs in terms of temporal and spatial resolution. The emergence of GNSS-R (Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry) technology provides an alternative method with high temporal and spatial resolution. An important application field of GNSS-R is soil moisture monitoring, but it is still in the initial stage of research, and there are many uncertainties and open issues. Based on a review of the current state-of-the-art of soil moisture retrieval using GNSS-R, this paper points out the limitations of existing research in observation geometry, polarization, and coherent and non-coherent scattering. The smooth surface reflectivity model, the random rough surface scattering model, and the first-order radiation transfer equation model of the vegetation, which are in the form of bistatic and full polarization, are employed. Simulations and analyses of polarization, observation geometry (scattering zenith angle and scattering azimuth angle), Brewster angle, coherent and non-coherent component, surface roughness, and vegetation effects are carried out. The influence of the EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power) and the RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) on soil moisture retrieval is briefly discussed. Several important development directions for space-borne GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval are pointed out in detail based on the microwave scattering model.},

@article{CGYNSS,
abstract = {This paper quantifies the relationship between forward scattered L-band Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, recorded by the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM). Although designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February 2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is 0.045 cm (super 3) /cm (super 3) and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM. These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions, could provide global SM observations. Abstract Copyright (2018), . American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},
